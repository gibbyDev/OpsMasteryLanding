### Light Beams
- Animated linear gradients at 45deg angles
- Keyframe animations rotating hue and position
- Applied to ::before/::after pseudo-elements
- Mix-blend-mode: screen for luminous effect

### Parallax Configuration
- Hero elements: 3 depth layers (background beams, main content, foreground particles)
- Feature sections: data-scroll-speed attributes (0.5 to -0.5 range)
- Images: subtle depth offset (2-5px range)

## Animation Strategy

### Entry Animations (on scroll)
- Fade + Slide Up: opacity-0 translate-y-12 â†’ opacity-100 translate-y-0
- Stagger Delay: children animate with 0.1s increments
- Duration: 0.6-0.8s with ease-out-quart easing

### Hover Animations
- Cards: transform scale-105 + glow increase
- Buttons: slight lift + glow expansion
- Icons: rotate or pulse effect
- Duration: 0.3s with ease-in-out

### Continuous Animations
- Light beams: infinite rotation (20-40s duration)
- Particle float: gentle Y-axis movement
- Gradient shifts: slow hue rotation (60s loop)
- Border pulse: opacity cycling on glassmorphic elements

### Locomotive Scroll Settings
- Smooth scrolling enabled globally
- Multiplier: 1.2 for slight momentum
- Lerp: 0.08 for fluid deceleration
